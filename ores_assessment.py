# TLDR: The main function, get_ores_assessment, takes in a list of article names and
# a language (English, Russian, or French). It then prints out each article's name,
# along with an automatically generated (machine learning oooohh) assessment of that
# article (Featured Article, Good Article, A-Class Article, B-Class Article, etc)
# This serves as one possible criterion by which users can sort articles.

# Note: We only use wp10 because this is what will give us the current article quality.
# We are not extremely concerned with draftquality

# Unfortunately, only three languages currently support automatic ORES wp10 assessment
# We hope that the impact of this function for sorting by article quality will increase
# as more languages begin to support ORES

if __name__ == "__main__":

# Performance notes:
# After an article has been queried, it seems that it is cached automatically, so if it is queried again,
# the process is much faster.
